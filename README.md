Hi, my name is Wanpet, I'm from Mexico (I don't know if it matters, but hey, the same XD)
I am a child, I will not say my age for my own safety but yes, I am a child, I have experience in malware and there are some very destructive ones like Warmex.exe, that is a wild animal literally, it destroys your pc and gives it to you in pieces, putting that aside, ya
WARNING:
It is recommended to use a Virtual Machine, since some can uninstall windows
i'm wanpet and use my advice, byeeee
